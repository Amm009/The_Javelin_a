# The_Javelin_a
This is a work in progress between Pyro-Technic (Justin Neyman) and I. It is currently in the middle stages of development.


The Main Control Housing (MCH) aka the remote control is built, but the code still needs work.

Code Features Implemented:

- Radio communication between Javelin(a) and the MCH
- Secondary display functionality for all states of the Javelin(a) and MCH
- Functional states (like "arming", "firing", or "failsafe") for the MCH


Code Features Still Being Worked on:

- Mapping controls received from the MCH to the servos and brushless motor
- Acceleration and deceleration detection for the Javelin(a)
- Javelin(a) states in the code are not quite working right yet

# More Details
The Javelin(a) is inspired by the javelin missile made by the U.S Military. Don't worry, it doesn't explode (for obvious reasons). The Javelin(a) is essentially a two stage remote controlled plane. The first is a rocket stage to launch it from the launch tube and get it up to flying speed. After the first stage finishes burning it is jettisoned. After the first stage is jettisoned, the wings fold out and a ducted fan is used to power flight. A small FPV camera is included in the nosecone of the plane to allow the pilot to fly the plane from the launch location.
