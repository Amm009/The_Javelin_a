# The_Javelin_a
This is a work in progress between my roomate and I. It is currently in the early to mid stages of development.

# More Details
The Javelin(a) is inspired by the javelin missile made by the U.S Military. Don't worry, it doesn't explode (for obvious reasons). The Javelin(a) is essentially a two stage remote controlled plane. The first is a rocket stage to launch it from the launch tube and get it up to flying speed. After the first stage finishes burning it is jettisoned. After the first stage is jettisoned, the wings fold out and a ducted fan is used to power flight. A small FPV camera is included in the nosecone of the plane to allow the pilot to fly the plane from the launch location.
